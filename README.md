# NixFlix

Click the .html file to open (written in Chrome).

My first Typescript project. Might take awhile. I've written NixFlix in javascript (my offline 1.0 project), but it took 100+ html linked pages, so obviously there's room to condense into a handful of pages so as not to overwhelm someone who clones this repo.
